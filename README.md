# CV application project (in progress)

Simple lenet mnist classification project with cpp (to "prove" my cpp skills)

## Description

This project is fairly basic, there are weights saved for a model
and a few png images for inference. There is no proper UI (at least yet),
since libtorch doesn't support tensorboard. Debugger is the UI.
